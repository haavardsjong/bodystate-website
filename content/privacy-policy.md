# Privacy Policy

## Privacy

At BodyState, we value your privacy and are committed to protecting your personal data. This Privacy Policy explains how BodyState collects, processes, and protects your data in compliance with applicable privacy laws, including the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).

## Key Principles

- No Personal Identifiable Information (PII): BodyState does not collect or store any data that can directly identify you, such as names, email addresses, or physical addresses.
- Anonymous Data Processing: All data collected is anonymized and cannot be linked to specific individuals.
- Data Minimization: We collect only the data strictly necessary to improve app performance and functionality.
- No Data Sharing: We do not share any user data with third parties for advertising or other non-functional purposes.

## 1. Data We Collect

We collect anonymized data for the purposes of app functionality, diagnostics, and performance analytics. This includes:

### 1.1 App Engagement and Performance Analytics

- **Purpose**: To improve app usability and performance.
- **Data Types**: App usage metrics (e.g., screens viewed, buttons clicked), device model, app version, and operating system version.
- **Data Processing**: Collected via Firebase Analytics and Firebase Crashlytics.

### 1.2 Diagnostic Data

- **Purpose**: To identify and fix app crashes and bugs.
- **Data Types**: Crash reports, performance logs, error messages, and device diagnostics.
- **Data Processing**: Collected via Firebase Crashlytics.

### 1.3 Health Data

- **Purpose**: To provide you with health insights and track your BodyState score.
- **Data Types**: Sleep, heart rate, HRV, and other health metrics accessed via Apple Health (with your explicit permission).
- **Data Processing**: All health data remains stored locally on your device. Aggregated, anonymized summaries (e.g., daily BodyState score) may be stored on our servers to provide app functionality. No personal health data is transmitted or stored outside your device in a form that can identify you.

## 2. How We Use Your Data

The data collected is used solely for:

- Providing BodyState functionality, including score calculations and health insights.
- Improving the app's performance and user experience.
- Diagnosing and fixing technical issues.

We do not use your data for marketing, advertising, or any purposes unrelated to app functionality.

## 3. Data Storage and Security

- **Local Storage**: Your health data is securely stored on your device and never transmitted to our servers in raw form.
- **Server Storage**: Anonymized aggregate data (e.g., daily scores) is stored on secure servers managed by Firebase.
- **Encryption**: All data transmitted between your device and our servers is encrypted using industry-standard protocols.
- **Access Control**: Only authorized personnel have access to aggregated, anonymized data for app improvement purposes.

## 4. Data Sharing

We do not share, sell, or rent your data to third parties. The only exception is the use of Firebase (a Google service) for analytics and crash reporting, which processes data under its own privacy policy. Firebase processes data in compliance with GDPR and other privacy regulations.

## 5. Your Rights

Under GDPR and other privacy laws, you have the following rights:

- **Access**: You can request information about the data we process about you.
- **Correction**: You can request corrections to any inaccurate data.
- **Deletion**: You can request the deletion of your data.
- **Portability**: You can request a copy of your data in a portable format.
- **Objection**: You can object to certain types of data processing.

To exercise any of these rights, please contact us at [insert contact email].

## 6. Data Retention

- **Health Data**: Stored locally on your device as long as you use the app. You can delete this data at any time through the app settings.
- **Analytics Data**: Retained for up to 14 months by Firebase Analytics.
- **Crash Reports**: Retained for up to 90 days by Firebase Crashlytics.

## 7. Third-Party Services

BodyState uses the following third-party services:

- **Firebase Analytics**: For app usage analytics.
- **Firebase Crashlytics**: For crash reporting and diagnostics.
- **Apple Health**: For accessing health data (with your permission).

These services have their own privacy policies, and we encourage you to review them.

## 8. Children's Privacy

BodyState is not intended for use by children under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect data from children under 13. If we become aware that we have inadvertently collected such data, we will delete it immediately.

## 9. Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time to reflect changes in our practices or legal requirements. Any changes will be posted within the app, and we will notify you of significant changes.

              "answer": {
                "p1": "BodyState transforms your health data into a battery for body and mind, helping you tailor your lifestyle, habits, and training programs to unlock your full potential.",
                "p2": "At its core, BodyState calculates a score from 1 to 100, representing your overall vitality and readiness. A score closer to 100 indicates that you are well-rested and ready to tackle life's challenges.",
                "p3": "The foundation of BodyState is built on six crucial metrics that significantly impact your health: sleep quality, heart rate variability (HRV), resting heart rate, fatigue (training load), respiratory rate, and wrist temperature. These metrics are measured against your personal 42-day baselines to assess your current state.",
                "p4": "You recharge your battery while you sleep. How well you recharge depends on your sleep stages—deep sleep provides extra recovery benefits, while awake periods during the night reduce the effectiveness of your rest. BodyState analyzes the quality of your sleep by examining these stages alongside your HRV and heart rate.",
                "p5": "During the day, your battery depletes, and the rate of depletion is influenced by your activity level and sleep pressure. High activity drains the battery more quickly, while sleep pressure builds the longer you stay awake."

              "question": "How does the BodyState Score work",
              "answer": {
                "p1": "The BodyState score ranges from 1 to 100, representing your overall vitality and readiness. A score closer to 100 indicates that you are well-rested and prepared to tackle life's challenges, while a lower score suggests that you might need rest and recovery. The BodyState score shouldn't necessarily dictate your daily activities, but it should help you be mindful of how you feel and make sound decisions about the type or intensity of your activities, potentially prioritizing more rest if needed.",
                "p2": "The score is calculated based on six key factors: sleep quality, fatigue (training load), sleeping heart rate variability (HRV), sleeping heart rate, respiratory rate, and wrist temperature. In simple terms the following will generally lead to a higher score:"

            "WhatareBaselines": {
              "question": "What are Baselines",
              "answer": {
                "p1": "A baseline is essentially your personal average range of the given health metric.",
                "p2": "In the context of BodyState, baselines are computed using up to 42 days of your tracked data. This approach ensures that the evaluation of your current health metrics is both personalized and reliable.",
                "p3": "Using baselines to evaluate today's state is crucial because health metrics vary widely among individuals. A baseline provides a personalized frame of reference, making your BodyState score uniquely tailored to you.",
                "h4": "How Baselines Are Computed",
                "p4": "To calculate a baseline, we use statistical methods to determine the average (mean) and the variability (standard deviation) of your health metrics over the chosen period.",
                "p5": "Here's a simplified example using sleep data, which applies similarly to other metrics like heart rate and HRV:"

              "question": "About Sleep",
              "answer": {
                "p1": "Sleep is the cornerstone of BodyState. It establishes a consistent protocol for measuring key metrics. Not only is sleep a crucial input for your BodyState, but it is also the period when HRV and resting heart rate are measured and compared to your history to assess your current state. High-quality sleep is vital for replenishing your body's energy, significantly enhancing your daily readiness and overall vitality."
              }

            "AboutFatigue": {
              "question": "About Fatigue",
              "answer": {
                "p1": "Fatigue, also known as Acute Training Load (ATL), measures your recent activity levels. It averages your daily active energy expenditure over the past seven days, prioritizing recent ones. ATL focuses on total workload, not training type. The method provides a clear picture of recent exertion and helps you manage your recovery needs."

              "question": "About Sleeping Heart Rate Variability (HRV)",
              "answer": {
                "p1": "Heart Rate Variability (HRV) is a key metric for assessing recovery and overall health. High HRV signals restfulness and readiness, while low HRV indicates stress or fatigue. Keeping HRV stable within your personal baseline is crucial, as very high values can also be concerning. BodyState monitors your HRV during sleep to reliably assess the effects of your lifestyle on your well-being."

              "answer": {
                "p1": "Sleeping Heart Rate (HR) is a key metric for understanding your fitness level and cardiovascular health. HR is the number of heartbeats per minute while at rest, showing how efficiently your heart works when inactive. Generally, a lower resting heart rate means better cardiovascular fitness and more efficient heart function, as your heart pumps more blood with fewer beats."

That's because BodyState can only assess your health data if it has some health history as a reference point. Sleep tracking with your iPhone is not supported. If you're unsure whether your sleep data is being tracked using your iPhone, check the Health app. Data tracked by the iPhone typically appears as \"in bed\" values.",

                "p1": "While not required, it is recommended that you turn on AFib History on your Apple Watch so it can record more heart rate samples during sleep. However, please note that turning on AFib History could potentially disable high heart rate alerts on your Apple Watch, so proceed with caution."

If you see data in Apple Health such as active calories and a detailed sleep reports and it is not being pulled in to BodyState, you should report this as a bug to us.

              "answer": {
                "p1": "There are several reasons why your widget might not be updating, many of which stem from iOS's stringent background processing restrictions designed to preserve battery life. Here are some common factors that could impact widget updates:",
                "p2": "**Background App Refresh Settings**: The widget relies on the app to refresh content in the background. If Background App Refresh is disabled for BodyState (Settings > General > Background App Refresh), the widget may not update as expected. Ensure this setting is enabled for BodyState.",
                "p3": "**Low Power Mode**: When your iPhone is in Low Power Mode, background activities, including widget updates, are significantly reduced to conserve battery. This can prevent the widget from fetching new data.",
                "p4": "**Network Connectivity**: A stable internet connection is necessary for the app to fetch the latest data. If your device has poor or no connectivity, the widget will not update.",
                "p5": "**iOS Widget Update Frequency**: iOS controls how often widgets can update to manage battery life and system performance. Widgets are not real-time displays and have limits on how frequently they can refresh. This means there might be a slight delay between when new data is available in the app and when it appears on the widget.",
                "p6": "**App Activity**: Widgets often update more frequently if the main app is used regularly. If you haven't opened BodyState in a while, iOS might reduce the frequency of its widget updates.",
                "p7": "**Widget Glitches**: Occasionally, widgets may experience temporary glitches. Removing the widget from your Home Screen and adding it back can sometimes resolve these issues.",

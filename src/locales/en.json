                "p2": "At its core, BodyState calculates a score from 1 to 100, representing your overall vitality and readiness. A score closer to 100 indicates that you are well-rested and ready to tackle life's challenges.",
                "p3": "The foundation of BodyState is built on four crucial metrics: sleep, fatigue, heart rate variability, and resting heart rate. These metrics significantly impact your health and are measured against your personal 6-week baselines to assess your current state.",
                "p4": "You recharge your battery while you sleep. How well you recharge depends on your sleep, HRV, and heart rate.",
                "p5": "During the day, your battery depletes, and the rate of depletion is influenced by your activity level and sleep pressure. High activity drains the battery more quickly, while sleep pressure builds the longer you stay awake."

                "p1": "The BodyState score ranges from 1 to 100, representing your overall vitality and readiness. A score closer to 100 indicates that you are well-rested and prepared to tackle life's challenges, while a lower score suggests that you might need rest and recovery. The BodyState score shouldn't necessarily dictate your daily activities, but it should help you be mindful of how you feel and make sound decisions about the type or intensity of your activities, potentially prioritizing more rest if needed.",
                "p2": "The score is calculated based on four key factors: sleep, fatigue, sleeping heart rate variability (HRV), and sleeping heart rate. In simple terms the following will generally lead to a higher score:"

                "p2": "In the context of BodyState, baselines are computed by evaluating at minimum 7 days, and up to 60 days of your tracked data. This approach ensures that the evaluation of your current health metrics is both personalized and reliable.",
                "p3": "Using baselines to evaluate today's state is crucial because health metrics vary widely among individuals. A baseline provides a personalized frame of reference, making your BodyState score uniquely tailored to you.",
